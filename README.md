# HR-Chatbot
A small model of an HR chatbot with few functionalities of an HR like recruitment of new applicants, asking about policies and one internal function i.e. asking for leave.

I made this chatbot with two technologies - one with deep learning and other one without deep learning.

You can see that there are two code files attached and the one with name *hrbot_tensorflow.py* uses tensorflow library which uses deep neural networks and other file with name *hrbot.py* uses Rasa NLU.


1. You have to install rasa_nlu using pip or you can also clone it using git command.
2. You have to create one database with table that contains holidays/leaves details of each employee.
3. You are all set, just hit run button.

Some screenshots are attached below -
