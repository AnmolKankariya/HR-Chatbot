# HR-Chatbot
A small model of an HR chatbot with few functionalities of an HR like recruitment of new applicants, asking about policies and one internal function i.e. asking for leave.

I made this chatbot with two technologies - one with deep learning and other one without deep learning.

The one with name *hrbot.py* uses rasa nlu library and the other two files *model.py* and *responses.py* uses Tensorflow library with deep neural network.

1. You have to install all the packages given in the code using pip or you can also clone packages like rasa_nlu using git command.
2. Then, you have to create one database with table that contains holidays/leaves records of each employee.
3. You are all set, just hit run button.

FOR DEEP LEARNING CHATBOT - 
1. Run *model.py* to build model first.
2. Run *responses.py* to use the model and fetch responses.
